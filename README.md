This is Quirkout! Quirkout is a workout log, tracker, and accountability booster for the harvard women's ultimate frisbee club. But, it could be used by any frisbee team.
Over the break our team members are supposed to keep log their workout completion and make note of areas they feel they have improved in. It is mostly done on excel sheets.
I wanted to create a more unified, designed, intuitive, and informative platform. I think I have created a space which encourages partcipation and accountability, but also personal improvement.

The team shares a team username and passwork, because teams are one unit and open books. There is already good team data under the username: Quasar and pw: star

When you get to the homepage you see this week's/today's stats. Donut charts show you how much of the team has meet our weekly workout goals and daily throwing goal.
below that you see the players who have done at least one exercise this week.

From the navigation bar you can add new players. When you add a new player make sure to enter a players full name, just in case you have two sarah's like quasar. Nicknames are great too.
"The learn and log workouts" dropdown menu has 4 pages which will teach you our team workouts and throw session. These workouts also incriment the individual exercises that they contain so
that when you log them, you get to see how much of each individual thing you have done without the hassel of entering it in every time.
It will also allow you to log a unique workout or exercise activity. Be sure to note whether the workout is in reps or time.
You don't have to log workouts right away, but it will help us make team goals if you do!

The team stats page shows the sum of all the exercises our team has ever done. This page is meant to motivate you and challenge eachother. The throw chart is there to set team goals.
In a given week you could try to increase throws by 50 or maybe even 100 (we do have 19 people on the actual team). It is also a place for coaches to look at team involvement.
The chart with pushups, pullups, and sldls is meant to be even when possible, some exercises are easier than others, but it is a fun way to keep track of acheivement.

Under player stats you must first pick the player which you would like to look at specifically. At the top of the player profile page you will see the badges that player has earned or
not earned so far that week. The badges are similar to the team goals on the home page, but these ones only contain individual information and will disapear with innactivity.
For players it is a good way to see what workouts they need to do and howmany times they've thrown.
Below their badges, players will see the exercises they have completed that week and the exercises they have completed over all time. Their weekly stats show them how active they have been recently
beyond meeting the team goals.
